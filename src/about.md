I don't really like talking about myself, but, needs must. If you only read one page about who I am and what I do this year, make it this one.

## TL;DR

I'm a web developer and Technical Lead with 10 years of experience. I'm passionate about Front End Dev, Performance, A11y, Pizza, and shouty music.

## Not long Enough

For about 10 years or so I've been building Websites, Applications, Digital Installations, and some other random bits in-between. This has been about a 50/50 split between full time at agencies, and as a freelancer working for one-person bands, to multi-million dollar startups and everyone in-between.

Over the years I've done a little bit of everything, but these days I've found myself working on modular-based websites, design systems, or startups. Most of my work over the last year or so has been based on Wordpress or Fractal, and a mix of different Static Site Generators.

I've played an active part in all stages of the project lifecycle. Working closely with Designers and Clients directly to define project goals and deliverables, to working with different teams of designers and developers to build those deliverables. I've joined projects at the very start of the processes, and have also been parachuted in days from launch to fix those last-minute bugs or add new features.

## Where in the world

I'm currently living in <del>sunny</del> rainy [Bristol, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol), after spending just under 4 years in [Vancouver, BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). I grew up in the town of [Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet,_Hampshire), went to [university](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/) in Bristol and have give or take been based there ever since.

I've also worked in Europe, Australia, and the United States for some shorter stints of time over the years.
