  excerpt: <p>To dive into the Hyborian Age, I built an interactive map using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, showing all the locations visited and the adventures had by Conan since his original introduction. I also worked with a prompt engineer and the team at <a href="https://automatic.chat/">Automatic.Chat</a> to implement the interactive Tavern Of Treachery text adventure game. All of this was built on top of a Wordpress-based low-code solution using <a href="https://bricksbuilder.io/">Bricks</a>.</p>
