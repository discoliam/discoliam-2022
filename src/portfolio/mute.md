  excerpt: <p>A super fun project, again working with Oku Studio. We focused on getting as much fun and life into the website as possible and having Mute on hand to provide custom animations for the logos, footer and menu toggle helped us achieve just that. We used a lot of <a href="https://airbnb.design/lottie/">Lottie</a> animations to keep the website feeling fresh, but also keep the page speed as fast as possible.</p>
