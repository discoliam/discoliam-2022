  excerpt: <p>Otaku Development wanted to move away from a traditional LAMP Stack and redesign its website at the same time. I took their new brand and worked up a new UX & UI experience. This was developed into a static website using 11ty, allowing Dan to easily host and update his website as required, reduce hosting costs and dramatically increase the site's performance and SEO scores.</p>
