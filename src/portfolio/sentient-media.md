  excerpt: <p>I was brought in to help Sentient Media launch their new brand with a refreshed website. We started fresh with a new theme build, and some dramatic tidying up of the existing database and content. Post-launch, we saw a huge improvement in Lighthouse scores, as well as reduced file sizes on both the front-end load and backend database, giving us a faster, more environmental friendly website.</p>
