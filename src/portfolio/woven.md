  excerpt: <p>I helped Oku Studio develop Wovens' new branding and logo into a complementary website and user experience. The addition of smooth scrolling from <a href="https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/">Locomotiv Scroll</a> and page transitions via <a href="https://barba.js.org/">Barba.js</a> makes this WordPress based site feel closer to an SPA and highlights Woven's creative energy and passion for video production.</p>
