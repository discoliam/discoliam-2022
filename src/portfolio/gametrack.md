  excerpt: <p>GameTrack asked me to help improve their site and bring in new features and performance updates. After some auditing, we elected to re-develop the site, in the process upgrade them to Vue 3, switch from an old UI library to Tailwind, and give a rock solid foundation for adding new features to compliment the suite of MacOS, iOS & iPadOS applications.</p>
