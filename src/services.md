<p class="Lead">A brief overview of what I can do, how I go about it, and the type of organisations I like to work for.</p>

## What I do

My work involves all types of digital products and services, of which I'm often involved in a variety of stages.

**UX / Strategy**

I love getting involved in the nitty-gritty of user research, workshops and UX design. I work closely with UI designers and brand managers to turn static assets and ideas into interactive & accessible digital products.

**Development**

Be it planning out the Technical architecture of a small website, or parachuting in to add new features to a legacy codebase, I've worked on all sorts of projects. I tend to specialize in front-end development, across a wide range of tech stacks and CMSs.

I try to focus on accessibility, performance and the environmental impact of all my work.

**Consultancy**

Clients often just need some help or guidance for their digital presence. Be it performance or accessibility audits and recommendations, technical architecture or a full website review, I love getting stuck into a project, investigating all the nuts and bolts and working out how we can any areas that may need work.

## How I work

If your team is big, small, or non-existent, I'm happy working with whoever is on board. I think collaboration is the key to successful projects, no matter if that's with other developers, designers, CEOs or any project stakeholder.

Once we're up and running, I like to choose the best tool for the job, and one that the rest of the team is comfortable with. But generally speaking, I find I'm often:

- Wireframing and prototyping in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
- Building proof of concepts using HTML/CSS/JS or in [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- Creating [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites from scratch
- Working with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) or [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) on more traditional server-side builds
- Building modern SPAs or static sites with tools such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- Crafting design systems in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Who I like to work with

My clients range from small one-person start-ups to international corporations, and everything in between. I like to work with clients who want to make the world a better place, however, they can. This includes charities and NGOs, political activists, environmentally friendly retailers, alternative transport and energy providers, arts organisations and public sector services.
