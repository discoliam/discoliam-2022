Originally designed and developed across the globe, this version was re-built September - December 2022 in Bristol UK, using a combination of blood, sweat, and [Stack Overflow](https://xkcd.com/979/).

Typeset in [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) by [Sorkin Type](http://sorkintype.com), and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) by [≈Åukasz Dziedzic](http://www.lukaszdziedzic.eu).

Orignal design by [Patricia Bernal](http://patriciabernal.ca/). Re-interpreted by me.

## Build

Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates. CSS is built using [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/).

Source code and more details available on [Github](https://github.com/discoliam/discoliam2022).

Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Previous Versions

I don't normally keep older versions of my website. But, I've manged to save a few more recent versions, if you're desperate to see work I now consider rather embarrassing.
